# maia-forecast
Human Design System Transits Tracker. This application can be used/installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager) alongside it.

Download Maia-Forecast by clicking on the green "CODE" button and selecting "Download ZIP" from https://github.com/tutucea/maya-forecast. Alternatively, you can download all the files individually and place them in the same folder.

Open a terminal (or Command Prompt for Windows) and navigate inside the folder where you downloaded the files by using the command: cd maya-forecast-app (replace "maya-forecast-app" with the actual folder name, if different).

Run the following command to install the required dependencies(ignore all the deprecated messages):    npm install

Start the application by running:     npm start

Every time you want to run it, you will need to use the terminal, navigate to the directory (cd into it), and run "npm start". To create your own DMG or EXE, navigate to the directory where all your files are located and run "npm run dist" or "npm run build". This will generate a directory called dist or buildâ€”open it, locate your DMG or EXE file, and install it YOURSELF.
