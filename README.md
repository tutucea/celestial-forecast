6. ##  Detailed Planetary Schedule

This application features a powerful, on-demand schedule viewer that provides in-depth transit data for each celestial body.

### How it Works
Simply click on any planet's symbol (e.g., â˜‰, â˜½) in the main window to open a dedicated popup with its full schedule.

### Key Features
*   **On-Demand Data:** Instantly access a detailed data table for any planet without cluttering the main view.
*   **Dynamic Timezone Conversion:** The schedule popup includes a robust timezone switcher. Users can instantly convert all timestamps to:
    *   Their own **local time**, which is detected automatically.
    *   **UTC** (Coordinated Universal Time).
    *   A customizable list of major world timezones.
*   **Comprehensive Information:** The table displays crucial data points for each transit, including Gate, Line, the exact Timestamp, Longitude, and Motion.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** The popup window includes controls to increase or decrease the text size for better readability.

*   do this if you only updating your files for the timezones, if you install everything there is no need
*   ```bash
    npm install luxon
    ```

### Linux (Ubuntu) Users
If you see a `chrome-sandbox` error (e.g., [this error](https://pastebin.com/8kZ6Uwnp)), run this before `npm start`:
```bash
sudo chown root chrome-sandbox && sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox
```
### Accuracy 
Please let me know if you see any discrepancies but before check this [Swiss Ephemeris - Swetest](https://www.astro.com/swisseph/swetest.htm)  or 
[JPL Horizons](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/)
### Notes
If you wish to change the notification sound, create a folder named "sounds" inside the directory where all the files are located, and place a file named notification.mp3 inside it.
You can also use your own notification soundâ€”just make sure to name it notification.mp3.


Every time you want to run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd celestial-forecast/
npm start
```

I do update the look once in a while also I will update the dates and times for all the crossings when they are about to expire.
