### Linux (Ubuntu) Users
If you see a `chrome-sandbox` error (e.g., [this error](https://pastebin.com/8kZ6Uwnp)), run this before `npm start`:
```bash
sudo chown root chrome-sandbox && sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox
```
### Accuracy 
Please let me know if you see any discrepancies but before check this [Swiss Ephemeris - Swetest](https://www.astro.com/swisseph/swetest.htm)
### Notes
If you wish to change the notification sound, create a folder named "sounds" inside the directory where all the files are located, and place a file named notification.mp3 inside it.
You can also use your own notification soundâ€”just make sure to name it notification.mp3.


Every time you want to run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd /celestial-forecast
npm start
```

I do update the look once in a while also I will update the dates and times for all the crossings when they are about to expire.
