# maya-forecast
Human design transit tracker for Moon, Sun, Nodes, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.

This can be installed on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Install Node.js:  download and install Node.js from the official website https://nodejs.org/en/download. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager) along with it.

Download Maia-Forecast by clicking on CODE and download as zip  https://github.com/tutucea/maya-forecast/archive/refs/heads/main.zip .. or simply download all the files individually in the same folder  

"cd maya-forecast-app" ( or whatever folder you downloaded the files) by using a terminal (cmd for windows)

"npm install"

"npm start"

This means that everytime you want to run it you will have to use the terminal and cd into the directory and run "npm start" .... 
If you wish to create your own DMG or EXE  cd into the directory where you have all your files and run "npm run dist
" or "npm run build" this will create a directory called dist or build, open it and find your dmg or exe file and install it yourself so you do not have to use the terminal every time you want to use it.

If you want to change the color, font, etc  edit "index.html", if you not happy with the times for the gate and line changes you can edit those too by using a free json editor. Whatever makes you happy . If you mess it up no worries, you can come back here and redownload it.
Good luck!!!!
