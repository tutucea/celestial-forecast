# maya-forecast
Human design transit tracker. This can be used/installed on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Download and install Node.js from the official website https://nodejs.org/en/download. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager) along with it.

Download Maia-Forecast by clicking on CODE and download as zip  https://github.com/tutucea/maya-forecast/archive/refs/heads/main.zip .. or simply download all the files individually in the same folder  

"cd maya-forecast-app" ( or whatever folder you downloaded the files) by using a terminal (cmd for windows)

"npm install"

"npm start"

Every time you want to run it, you will need to use the terminal, navigate to the directory (cd into it), and run "npm start". To create your own DMG or EXE, navigate to the directory where all your files are located and run "npm run dist" or "npm run build". This will generate a directory called dist or build—open it, locate your DMG or EXE file, and install it yourself.

Good luck!!!!
